# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. Collaborative filtering is a technique that makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the preference of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating).

The recommendation system analyzes user ratings to identify patterns and similarities between users, ultimately suggesting movies that a user might like based on the preferences of similar users.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

# Dataset
The recommendation system is built on a movie dataset containing user ratings. The dataset may include information such as user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings. You can use publicly available datasets like MovieLens or any other suitable dataset for movie recommendations.

# Collaborative Filtering
This system utilizes collaborative filtering, a method that identifies users who are similar to the target user and recommends items that those similar users have liked. The two main types of collaborative filtering are user-based and item-based. This project may focus on one of these or a hybrid approach depending on the implementation.

# Implementation
The Jupyter Notebook contains the step-by-step implementation of the recommendation system. It covers data loading, data exploration, user-item matrix creation, similarity computation, and recommendation generation. The code is well-documented with comments to aid understanding.

# Data Visualization
Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for data visualization. The distribution of user ratings is visualized to provide insights into the overall preferences of the user base.

# Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movierecsys.git
    cd movierecsys
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook MovieRecommendationSystem.ipynb
    ```
    Open the notebook in your browser and execute each cell step by step.

4. **Explore Recommendations:**
    Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore personalized movie recommendations based on collaborative filtering.

# Future Improvements
- Incorporate more advanced collaborative filtering techniques.
- Implement a user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
- Explore deep learning models for recommendation systems.
