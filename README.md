# Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system based on collaborative filtering using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Jupyter Notebook. Collaborative filtering is a technique that makes automatic predictions (filtering) about the preference of a user by collecting preferences from many users (collaborating).

The recommendation system analyzes user ratings to identify patterns and similarities between users, ultimately suggesting movies that a user might like based on the preferences of similar users.
